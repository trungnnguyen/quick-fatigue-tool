This document provides a quick guide for getting started with Quick Fatigue Tool.
For a complete description of the code and its features, please consult the
Quick Fatigue Tool User Guide.


%   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
%   ==========================
%	>> The tutorial_intro example exits with errors
%	
%	The intro tutorial is already configured to run to completion without
%	additional preperation from the user. Therefore, if the analysis exits
%	with errors, it is possible that the required files are not in the
%	Project/input folder. Both 'stress_uni.dat' and 'history_fully_reversed.dat'
%	must be in this folder for the analysis to complete successfully.
%
%	Another possible cause is that not all the required files are on the
%	MATLAB path. Select the 'Application_Files' and 'Project' folders from the
%	current folder window, right-click and select 'Add to Path -> Selected
%	Folders and Subfolders'.
%
%	>> MATLAB Figures won't open
%
%	This is a known issue which affects users running MATLAB R2015a. Figures
%	are written to the output folder but cannot be opened. A fix is being
%	worked on. In the meantime, the figure format may be changed to an
%	image extension such as .png or .jpg using the environment variable
%	'figureFormat'. Consult Section 10 of the User Guide for more information.
%
%   >> The Quick Fatigue Tool MATLAB apps do not display correctly; labels
%      and text is misaligned or cut off
%
%   The apps are optimized for a 1920x1080 screen. Running the apps on other
%   screen sizes may cause UI object to appear incorrectly. Re-size the window
%   if necessary. On Windows machines, UI objects look best when the global
%   icon size is set to 125% (Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Display)
%
%	>> When starting the Material Manager App, materials do not appear in the
%	local database
%
%	This is a bug. Switch to the System Database, then switch back to Local.
%	The materials in the Local Database should now appear as normal.
%
%	>> When starting the Material Manager App, materials do not appear in the
%	local database even after switching databases as above. Also when trying to
%	create a material, the user receives the following error: "Undefined function
%	or variable 'UserMaterial'"
%
%	The necessary files are probably not on the MATLAB path. Select the
%	'Application_Files' and 'Project' folders from the current folder window, 
%	right-click and select 'Add to Path -> Selected Folders and Subfolders'.
%
%	>> When starting an analysis with the Multiaxial Gauge Fatigue App, the
%	user receives the following error: "Error while processing material
%	'material.mat'. The file could not be located."
%
%	Make sure all the fodlers are added to the MATLAB path. Run the
%	Multiaxial Gauge Fatigue App directly from the M-File: Right-click on
%	Application_Files/source/multiaxial_gauge_fatigue/MultiaxialFatigue.m and
%	select "Run".
%
%   PERFORMING AN ANALYSIS
%   ======================
%
%   All user definitions are specified in the script <job>.m. Running 
%	<job>.m starts the analysis.
%
%   LOADING METHODS
%   ===============
%
%   The loading is defined by stress datasets and load histories.
%   The loading can be defined in three ways:
%
%   SIMPLE LOADING
%   A stress dataset is combined with a load history.
%
%   MULTIPLE LOAD HISTORY (SCALE-AND-COMBINE)
%   FEA results may contain multiple stress datasets defining several
%   sequential or combined loading events. Each result is specified by a
%   separate stress dataset. A load history is multiplied by each dataset.
%   The resulting loadings are combined to form a single loading definition
%   for the whole model.
%
%   DATASET SEQUENCE
%   The loading is defined by a sequence of stress datasets.
%
%   The stress data can be an .rpt file generated by Abaqus, or a user-defined
%   .dat or .txt file containing the stress tensors for each item in the
%   finite element model. The load history is a .txt or .dat file containing
%   a series of scale factors corresponding to the channel with which it
%   is paired.
%
%   Examples:
%   Define a simple loading using .dat files:
%       dataset = 'channel.dat';
%       history = 'scale.dat';
%
%   Define a multiple load history
%       dataset = {'channel_1.rpt', 'channel_2.rpt',..., 'channel_N.rpt'};
%       history = {'scale_1.dat', 'scale_2.dat',..., 'scale_N.dat'};
%
%   Define a dataset sequence
%       dataset = {'channel_1.rpt', 'channel_2.rpt',..., 'channel_N.rpt'};
%       history = [];
%
%   When specifying multiple dataset/history pairs, each stress dataset must
%	refer to the same model. Hence, the number of items in each dataset
%	file must be the same. The length of each load history does not have
%   to be the same.
%
%   GENERATING A USER-DEFINED STRESS DATASET
%   ========================================
%
%   If the stress channels are defined as a .dat file, the following format
%   must be obeyed:
%
%   LINE 1:            S1_11 S1_22 S1_33 S1_12 S1_13 S1_23
%   LINE 2:            S2_11 S2_22 S2_33 S2_12 S2_13 S2_23
%   .                  .
%   .                  .
%   .                  .
%   LINE N:            SN_11 SN_22 SN_33 SN_12 SN_13 SN_23
%
%   Where SN_11 to SN_23 are the six components of the Cauchy stress tensor
%   at the Nth item in the model. If the model is in a state of plane stress,
%	the last two components can either be set to zero or omitted from the
%	definition.
%
%   GENERATING A STRESS DATASET FROM ABAQUS
%   =======================================
%
%   1. In Abaqus/CAE, switch to the Visualization module
%   2. Go to "Result -> Options". Make sure that the option "Average element
%   output at nodes" is unchecked
%   3. Go to "Report -> Field Output..."
%   4. In the variable tab, choose the output position. The following
%   positions are supported:
%   - Integration Point
%   - Centroid
%   - Element Nodal
%   - Unique nodal
%   5. Expand the "S: Stress components" tree and check the last 6 variables
%   (the Cauchy stress tensor). Make sure that all other boxes are unchecked.
%	If plane stress elements were used, only the last 4 variables need to be
%	selected
%   6. In the "Setup" tab under "Output Format", make sure the layout style
%   is set to "Single table for all field output variables"
%   7. Under "Data", uncheck "Column totals" and "Column min/max" as these
%   are not required. GETITEMS has not been validated for RPT files with
%   this information included
%
%	When generating FEA definition files from Abaqus using plane stress
%	elements, TENSOR_TYPE should be set to a value of 1.0 in the job file.
%
%   GENERATING A LOAD HISTORY
%   =========================
%
%   The load history file contains a 1xN or Nx1 vector of loading points.
%   For a fully-reversed loading, the loading file would be defined as follows:
%
%   LINE 1:            1
%   LINE 2:            -1
%
%   The analysis does not recognise the amount of elapsed time between
%   history points.
%
%   MATERIAL PROPERTIES
%   ===================
%
%   Material properties are defined using the Material Manager utility. The
%   installer is found in the TOOLBOX directory.
%
%   Only materials in the workspace directory are accessible by the program.
%   Materials from the system database can be fetched to the workspace by
%   pressing the fetch button in the Material Manager, or by double-clicking
%	on the material name.
%
%   ANALYSIS OPTIONS
%   ================
%
%   Job-specific analysis settings are set by options in the job file. Analysis
%   settings which apply to all jobs are set by environment variables in the
%   file 'environment.m'.
%
%   For a detailed description on how to use job options and environment variables,
%   consult the Quick Fatigue Tool User Settings Reference Guide.
%
